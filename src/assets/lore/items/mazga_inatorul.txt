Mazga-Inatorul is a gruesome weapon. It is created by the people of ToXi Faction, where chemicals and bio-weapons are being used as their main form of damage. This sword is equipped with a horrible toxin called EnergizantProxi. The wielder can pull the trigger to coat the blade in a layer of toxin, thus weakening the enemies upon strike.
