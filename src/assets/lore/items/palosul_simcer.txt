Forged by the godly blacksmiths of Brigada Iahnie, the majestic Magik Palos can deal some serious damage and burns to the enemies, as it is made using magic magma and iron alloys. The magical crystal is what keeps the shape of the weapon, and it's origin is unknown. Brigada Iahnie collects the crystals from the monsters of Pandora's Box, as they drop them upon their death.
