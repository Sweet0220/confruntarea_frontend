Little is known about the time Boner Baiatu' Fistic was a normal human being. All that is known is that he was a fierce man and had a very strong will to live. So strong that he literally scolded the Grim Reaper when his time of death was due. Boner pursued his will to become a warrior mage and he trained so intensely that he eventually became a skeleton. He fought in many wars and gathered a lot of fighting experience, so the Pandora's Box incident is just another war for him to take part in.
