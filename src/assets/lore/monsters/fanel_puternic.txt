Fanel Puternic is bad news. The moment he stepped foot in our world, things went really bad. First of all, he spreads The Plague. A terrible disease that infects both humans and animals with less developed immune systems. His skin is covered in pores that emit particles of the disease. Second of all, he is big and strong and pretty hard to kill. His attacks deal serious damage as he can use his claws and tendrils to tear into his opponents.
