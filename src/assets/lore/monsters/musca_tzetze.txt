Musca Tzetze is an entity that came from The Void. A terrible place filled with unthinkable creatures with all sorts of features. Musca is a small creature that kind of resembles an octopus when you look at the tentacles and when you see how it uses them. The brain is exposed, thus making it quite an easy monster to kill. It feeds on the flesh of any creature, be it from Earth or any other dimension.
