Daniel was adopted by a loving girl at a very early stage in his life. He used to be like any other dog, playful, humble and he loved his owner. Until Pandora's Box was opened... His owner was killed by the horrific monsters that came out of the portal. Daniel was all alone after that, desperate and trying to find food and shelter in the dying world. Until one day... A soldier on duty saw him. Daniel was taken into the homebase of the Iahnie Brigade, where he was finally safe. Several days later, he got curious and entered one of the Thermo-Mech suits. It was a perfect fit. He was somehow innate at maneuvering the suit. Everybody was amazed, after all Daniel wasn't just a dog. The soldiers trained him and Daniel became one of the most fierce fighters of the Iahnie Brigade. Daniel swore to revenge his lost family and to remove all evil from the world.
